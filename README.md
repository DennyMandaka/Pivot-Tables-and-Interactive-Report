# Pivot Tables and Interactive Report 
## Project Objective
To demonstrate the use of aggregation functions, Pivot Tables, Slicers, Timelines, and Pivot Charts in Excel to create an interactive report.

## Dataset(s)
- The <a href="https://github.com/DennyMandaka/Pivot-Tables-and-Interactive-Report/blob/main/Pivot%20Tables%20and%20Interactive%20Report.xlsx">dataset</a> was generated from Mockaroo. This synthetic dataset includes columns such as Campaign Category, Ad Cost, Impressions, Clicks, Conversions, and Revenue from Ad, designed to mimic a marketing campaign dataset.

## Data Cleaning and Summarizing Data using Pivot Tables
- Converting the .csv file to an Excel sheet using Power Query.
- Checking for blank cells and duplicate values.
- Adding new calculated columns to prepare for Pivot Table analysis and visualization, such as Cost per Click, Cost per Conversion, Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).

## Process
- Use the filter button to check for blank or null values.
- Use Data Validation to check the value format.
- Use aggregation functions like SUM, AVERAGE, and basic mathematical formulas.
- Use Pivot Tables to analyze and aggregate the data.
- The interactive report page with a Slicer and Timeline looks like <a href="https://github.com/DennyMandaka/Pivot-Tables-and-Interactive-Report/blob/main/Ads%20Spending%20Report.png">this</a>.

## Insights and Conclusion
- The use of Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Timeline in Excel allows for efficient data aggregation and analysis, providing valuable insights from marketing campaign data.
- The interactive report, enhanced by Slicers and Pivot Charts, provides a dynamic tool for business stakeholders to explore data trends and make data-driven decisions.
- This project highlights the importance of using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to perform ad hoc analysis when assessing the performance of a marketing campaign.
